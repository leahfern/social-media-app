## About
This application is close in relation to a social media app that many of us use, today.  On the site of the application, you will find, components of a header bar, then a post input section, followed by the posts.  The posts themselves have a reaction bar with Like and comment icon functionality then the ability to add a comment in the input bar which once added will open the comments section.

There are a lot of updates I could make to this application including a login option with a few users, so that storage can hold what users are commenting and liking posts.  Adding or updating a users profile with picture, activating the ability to add media, adding the menu drop down on the top left, and fully activating all other icon/text combo reactions similar to other social media apps.
